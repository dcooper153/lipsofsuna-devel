/**
 * \brief Stores a list of paths, and a cache of filenames found in those directories.
 *
 * When a LIPthPaths is constructed with \ref lipth_paths_new , it takes a root directory and a module name. The root directory acts is the base of the default path to search for files.
 * - \ref _LIPthPaths::module_data is the base path for searching for data files.
 * - \ref _LIPthPaths::module_data_save is the base path used for loading and saving game files.
 * - \ref _LIPthPaths::module_config is the base path used for loading and saving configuration.
 * - \ref _LIPthPaths::paths contains a linked list of paths that have already been added.
 *
 * By default `<module_data>` and `<module_data_save>` are added to \ref _LIPthPaths::paths , addtional paths are added by calling \ref lipth_paths_add_path, which will add `<module_data>/<sub_path>` and `<module_data_save>/<sub_path>`. When a path is added it will scan the path for files and each filename found into the dictionary \ref _LIPthPaths::files. If a file of the same name already exists, the most recently found one replaces any previously found. If an existing path is added again, \ref _LIPthPaths::paths is left unchanged but the directories are scanned, with new/existing files added/updated to \ref _LIPthPaths::files accordingly.
 *
 * Configuration files and save files are handled by a special mechanism, of calling \ref lipth_paths_create_file . Despite the name, this function doesn't actually create a file, but instead creates a full path to the desired file into either configuration directory or save directory based upon the config option. The path is `<module_config>/<name>` if config is non-zero or `<moduel_data_save>/<name>` if config is zero.
 *
 * The following paths don't refer to members of LIPthPaths or function parameter, but special system as described below:
 * - `<system_config_home>` refers to the path of the directory used for storing configuration, as obtained by \ref lisys_paths_get_config_home  (e.g. `/home/username/.config`).
 * - `<system_global_data/lipsofsuna>` refers to the path where the data directory with `lipsofsuna` was found in user's home data paths, as found by \ref lisys_paths_get_data_home .
 * - `<system_data_home>` refers to the path of the directory used for storing data in the users home directory, as obtained by \ref lisys_paths_get_data_home (e.g. `/home/username/.local/share`).
